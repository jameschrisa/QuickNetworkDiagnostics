# Network Diagnostics Script

This bash script performs a series of network diagnostics to help troubleshoot connectivity issues. It runs various Unix commands to check network status and attempts to interpret the results.

## Features

- Internet connectivity check
- Ping test
- Traceroute analysis
- DNS resolution check
- Open ports examination
- Error handling and logging
- Basic interpretation of results

## Prerequisites

This script is designed to run on Unix-like operating systems (Linux, macOS, etc.) and requires bash. Some of the diagnostic tools used by the script may need to be installed separately:

- `ping`
- `traceroute`
- `nslookup`
- `netstat`

Most of these tools come pre-installed on many Unix-like systems, but you may need to install them if they're missing.

## Installation

1. Download the `network_diagnostics.sh` script to your local machine.
2. Make the script executable:

   ```
   chmod +x network_diagnostics.sh
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```
./network_diagnostics.sh
```

Note: Some network diagnostic commands may require root privileges. If you encounter permission errors, try running the script with `sudo`:

```
sudo ./network_diagnostics.sh
```

## Output

The script will provide real-time logging of its actions and findings. Each log entry is timestamped for easy reference. Here's an example of what you might see:

```
[2024-08-16 10:30:15] Starting network diagnostics
[2024-08-16 10:30:16] Internet connection is working (pinged google.com successfully)
[2024-08-16 10:30:18] Ping to 8.8.8.8 successful. Average round-trip time: 15.123 ms
[2024-08-16 10:30:25] Traceroute to google.com completed with 12 hops
[2024-08-16 10:30:26] DNS resolution for example.com successful. IP: 93.184.216.34
[2024-08-16 10:30:27] Found 37 open ports
[2024-08-16 10:30:27] Network diagnostics completed
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run network diagnostic tools.
2. Check that all required commands (`ping`, `traceroute`, etc.) are installed on your system.
3. If a specific test fails, try running that command manually to see if you get more detailed error messages.

## Customization

You can modify the script to add more tests, change the targets for ping and traceroute, or adjust the interpretation logic. Look for the main function in the script to add or modify tests.
